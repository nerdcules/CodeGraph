# Changelog

Each release is a tag `v<version>`, built and published by the [release workflow](../.github/workflows/release.yml).
The executables report their version with `--version`; the MCP server shows it to its client.

## 1.0.0

The first packaged release. Everything below was built between August and November 2026.

### Install

- Prebuilt archives for Linux, macOS and Windows on x64 and arm64, each with its own .NET runtime, the
  TypeScript extractor and its packages. `install.sh` and `install.ps1` download the one for your platform,
  verify its checksum and set up a repository; `--from-source` builds a checkout as before.
- The Obsidian plugin ships as `codegraph-obsidian.zip`.
- `codegraph-index init` writes the repository's `.mcp.json`, ignores `.codegraph/` and builds the first graph.

### Graph

- C# through Roslyn, in process; TypeScript, JavaScript and Angular through the TypeScript compiler; Java,
  Kotlin, Scala, Go, Rust and Python through their SCIP indexers. One graph holds several languages.
- Calls, references, inheritance, implementation, overrides, tests, project dependencies and framework
  entry points as compiler-resolved edges. A call to an interface member counts for every implementation.
- Incremental re-indexing by file hash; a full rebuild swaps a fresh file in with one rename.
- Each language records its compiler, the language versions the code uses and the errors it hit, so
  `index_status` says when a repository is newer than the compiler that read it.

### Tools

- 35 MCP tools over stdio: find, callers, callees, impact, tests, dead code, full-text and semantic search,
  graph statistics and usage statistics.
- Every answer is checked against the working tree first and marked `STALE` where it is behind.
- Walk answers are capped at the nearest 200 rows per depth, with a count of the rest.

### Live

- `codegraph-index --watch` keeps the compiled solution in memory, re-indexes a save in well under a second
  and answers `check_change`, `rename_preview`, `diagnostics`, `live_references` and `data_flow` over a pipe.
- For TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust and Python the same tools go through the language server when one is on PATH.

### Tested

- 390 .NET tests, 11 extractor tests and the Obsidian plugin's tests run on every push on Linux, macOS and Windows.
- A generated corpus in eight languages, with an answer key, scores precision and recall at 100% on current
  toolchains in a modern and a classic dialect, and on older SDK images in Docker (.NET 8, Node 20, JDK 17,
  Go 1.21, Rust 1.70, Python 3.8). [BENCHMARKS.md](BENCHMARKS.md) has every number.
